# TidyPaste
Tired of markup ruining your pasting? Try TidyPaste!\
Is the Electron framework overkill for this? Yep! But I wrote the whole thing in 15 minutes. So there.

## Usage
1. Copy something.\
2. Click on the TidyPaste icon in your tray.\
3. Paste trimmed plain text!\
That's it.

## But... But, why?
I am tired of the paste-as menu, or the little arrow drop down after I paste, or other random nonsense that get's pasted, or not having those options show up at all and having to paste into a plain-text editor first.\
The struggle is real.
